        <h1 class="center-text-white">AUDIO PRODUCTION - "THE ORACLE"</h1>
           <p>During my multimedia studies, I developed a passion for audio production. One of my key projects was "The Oracle," a low-poly 3D first-person puzzle game created with Annelies Adamache, Damian Nowakowski, and Kiera Loughar-Clarke as our thesis project.</p>
           <p>As the sound developer and composer, I crafted the game's audio landscape, including original music compositions and sound effects to enhance gameplay. I used the DAW Cubase for this project, and I learned how to use Audacity and Adobe Audition throughout my studies.</p>
           <p>Working on "The Oracle" taught me the importance of collaboration and the role of audio in creating immersive experiences. This project refined my technical skills and deepened my understanding of how sound drives narrative. I am proud of this work and look forward to applying these insights to future projects.</p>

            <h2>Trailer</h2>
               <p>Here is a trailer for "The Oracle," featuring a song I composed specifically for the game. Although this song was not included in the final game, we decided to put it in the trailer as it perfectly fits the theme: mysterious, mythical, and deceptive. The music evokes intrigue and excitement, complementing the game's visual story and narrative. See the trailer to learn more about the game.</p>

            <h2>Narration</h2>
               <p>This video features compelling narration for "The Oracle," voiced by Patrick Sode. The narration also features another original composition I created. I worked closely with Patrick to ensure the voiceover and music blend seamlessly, supporting the game's storyline and emotional tone. Watch the video to experience the integration of narrative and music.</p>

      <h2>The Forest Song</h2>
      <p>This is another original song I composed for the game specifically for the start of the game.Using the soft sounds of flute, strings, and harp, this music sets a peaceful tone and gives players a sense of calm as they begin the game. It’s meant to feel like a quiet walk through the forest, capturing the stillness while hinting that there’s more to discover.</p>

           <p>My deep interest in video production has led me to work on various projects during my studies, showcasing my skills in storytelling, visual design, and technical execution.</p>

            </video>
            <h2>"NATURAL" MUSIC VIDEO</h2>
               <p>This is a music video I filmed and edited on Adobe Premiere Pro to the song "Natural" by Imagine Dragons. It explores a daughter's emotional journey as she escapes her troubled relationship with her father.</p>
               <p>Originally, the plot centred on a man leaving a toxic relationship. However, an actor’s sudden leaving made a significant change to the story.</p>
               <p>I adapted the storyline to focus on family and personal resilience, creating a raw and personal portrayal of the protagonist's journey. This adaptation created a captivating story that brings out the characters' emotional depth and complexity.</p>

            <h2>TIMELESS CLASSIC</h2>
               <p>This advertisement, created with Damian Nowakowski, Kiet Ngo, and Reoland Pepa, using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects,  features Bonnie Tyler's song "Holding Out for a Hero." It highlights the timeless elegance and enduring appeal of Versace fragrance.</p>
               <p>We designed this to showcase the perfume's lasting impact across different eras. We added comedic elements to keep it funny and relevant.</p>
               <p>The ad uses a timeline to take viewers through historical periods from “The Creation of Adam” to  the man on the Moon.</p>

            <h2>"THE BLOOM" LYRIC VIDEO</h2>
               <p>I created this lyric video to the song "The Bloom" by Wesley Joseph using Adobe After Effects and Illustrator. I designed elements like the eyeball and magnifying glass in Illustrator.</p>
               <p>This project was an opportunity to experiment with typography and animation, which are synchronised to the music to enhance the overall experience.</p>
               <p>The visuals reflect the song's mood, creating an engaging and cohesive experience. The video showcases how effectively blending lyrics with visuals can elevate the impact of the music.</p>

         <h2>SERENIFY</h2>
           <p>Serenify is a compact, screenless wearable device designed to help stressed college students manage anxiety. Controlled via a smartphone app for iPhone and Android, it detects high heart rates and guides users through calming vibrational breathing patterns. This mock-up design combines wellness and technology, allowing users to monitor stress, engage in personalised mindfulness practices, and track mood for mental well-being.</p>

      <div class="budget-buddie-text">
      <h2>BUDGET BUDDIE</h2>
        <p>Budget Buddie is a mobile app designed to help users manage their finances better, which I did in collaboration with Kiera Lougar-Clarke, Reoland Pepa, and Jenny Nguyen. It assists users in creating a budget template, planning savings for short and long-term goals, and understanding banking terminology. The app is tailored for college students and anyone looking to improve their financial management skills.</p>
        <p>Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User-Friendly Design: Intuitive navigation with clear instructions and prompts.</li>
          <li>Clean Interface: Simple, easy-to-use interface with clear labels and buttons.</li>

          </video>
          <h2>MY FIRST WEBTSITE</h2>
            <p>This is my first ever coding project that combines a bit about myself, my photography, and personal hobbies. The website features a modern minimalist design with clean lines, ample white space, and a cohesive colour scheme.</p>

            <p>This is a fun and interactive "Guess the Word" game that I developed. Players have limited guesses to guess the word based on the length of the word, choose their preferred colour scheme, and replay the game as many times as they like. It offers a clean, customisable, and engaging experience.</p>
            <p>I used HTML5, CSS3 for themes, JavaScript for game logic and interactivity, and Local Storage to save preferences.</p>

         <h2>MARVEL QUIZ</h2>
           <p>As a Marvel fan, I created a fun and engaging quiz to test players' knowledge of the Marvel universe. The colour scheme is inspired by Marvel's iconic red, blue and gold.</p>
           <p>I used HTML5, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for quiz logic and interactivity.</p>
           <p>Key Features:<p>
            <ul>
             <li>Marvel-themed colours for an immersive experience.</li>

           <!--still the graphic design section but specifically work i did while i was a public relations officer in DCU-->
           <p class="center-text">Through my time in DCU I was also the Public Relations Officer for the Arts & Crafts Society at Dublin City University. I embraced the role of bringing creativity and visual engagement to our community. Each poster I designed reflects the unique spirit of the events we hosted.</p>
           <p class="center-text">My role extended beyond poster design to managing our Instagram account, ensuring that each post captured the essence of our society's vibrancy and connected with our audience. My efforts in crafting these visuals and steering our social media presence have honed my skills in visual communication.</p>
